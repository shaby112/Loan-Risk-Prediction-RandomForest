# Loan Risk Predicition

I did this project as a part of an internship program. It uses Decisin Trees and Random Forest classification to analyze and predict whether or not the borrower will pay back their loan in full. The project notebook contains everything from data cleaning to exploratory data analysis to final model classification report.
